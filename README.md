# My Portforlio Frontend
I decided to use React with Typescript to build out my personal portfolio site. This was kind of a bit of overkill since it is mostly a static web page but I wanted to practice my React skills. I also decided to try out TailwindCSS and I must say that while it took me a bit to get it going, once I had it installed and got a little familiar with it, Tailwind is pretty fantastic to work with. Here is a link to my live [portfolio page](https://www.bryanoyloe.com) if you would like to check it out. You can send me a message through the page if you have questions or reach out to me at boyloe@gmail.com.
